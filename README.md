## Objective

I am an experienced front-end developer who has over a decade of experience working for large and small
teams alike. I'm seeking a job with like-minded developers where I can be challenged as part of a real team,
working towards real goals. I enjoy learning new things, and have found that teaching others is the best way to
cement my own skills. My passion is creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces, and I'm looking for an
employer that needs someone who can deliver CSS and Javascript magic.

## Skills and Technologies
* I love Javascript. Node, React, with or without Redux, noSQL storage, react-native, electron or ionic.
* Typechecking (TypeScript, Flow-Typed)
* Very familiar working  within Firebase ecosystem, and would love to try other cloud-based solutions.
* Familiar with various database and storage systems including MongoDB, SVG, and indexedDB in the browser.
* Happy to use Git for version control, but am also familiar with SVN.
* I have learned to use many one-off libraries and APIs for specific projects, such as Highcharts, three.js, snap.svg, various Google products (analytics, adsense, fonts, youtube, places, etc..)
* I have the ability to pick up new technologies, libraries and API, and use them without hand-holding.
* I'm also very experienced CSS including Animations/Transitions, Responsive techniques, JSS and SCSS/LESS.
* Quick to adapt to existing standards and best practices, as well as new frameworks, libraries and modules.
* Experience developing apps across browsers, and many platforms, and leaning new ones
