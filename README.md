### Front End Web Developer
#### benniaustindev@gmail.com

## Objective

I am an experienced web developer who has over a decade of experience working for large and small
teams alike. I'm seeking a job with like-minded developers where I can be challenged as part of a real team,
working towards real goals. I enjoy learning new things, and have found that teaching others is the best way to
cement my own skills. My passion is creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces, and I'm looking for an
employer who needs someone who can deliver CSS and Javascript magic.

## Skills and Technologies
* Javascript (es6) (Vanilla JS, React, Backbone, Angular, Node, Jquery, Prototype, etc)
* Familiarity with indexedDB and webSQL, localstorage, as well as traditional cookie based storage, as
well as Loki.js.
* I have learned to use many one-off libraries and APIs for specific projects, such as Highcharts, three.js
snap.svg, various Google products (analytics, adsense, fonts, youtube, etc..), and more jQuery plugins
than I can remember including jqueryUI and jqueryMobile.
* I have the ability to pick up new technologies, libraries and API, and use them without hand-holding.
* CSS3 (SCSS, Animations/Transitions, Responsive techniques)
* Have worked within multiple version control systems, including SVN, GIT and TFS
* Quick to adapt to existing standards and best practices, as well as new frameworks, libraries and CMSs.
* Experience developing apps across browsers, as well as some familiarity using Cordova (phone-gap)
and React Native to create mobile applications.
* I have focused on the front end, but am familiar with back end languages such as NodeJS, PHP and
Java.
