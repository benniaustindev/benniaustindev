## Objective

I am an experienced front-end developer who has over a decade of experience working for large and small teams alike. I'm seeking a job with like-minded developers where I can be challenged as part of a real team, working towards real goals. I enjoy learning new things, and have found that teaching others is the best way to cement my own skills. My passion is creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces, and I'm looking for an employer that needs someone who can deliver CSS and Javascript magic.

* Very familiar working  within Firebase ecosystem, and would love to try other cloud-based solutions.
* Familiar with various database and storage systems including MongoDB, SQL, and indexedDB in the browser.

* I have learned to use many one-off libraries and APIs for specific projects, such as Highcharts, three.js, snap.svg, various Google products (analytics, adsense, fonts, youtube, places, etc..)
* I have the ability to pick up new technologies, libraries and API, and use them without hand-holding.
* I'm also very experienced CSS including Animations/Transitions, Responsive techniques, JSS and SCSS/LESS.
