        <p>I am an experienced front-end developer who has over a decade of experience working for large and small teams alike. I'm seeking a job with like-minded developers where I can be challenged as part of a real team, working towards real goals. I enjoy learning new things, and have found that teaching others is the best way to cement my own skills. My passion is creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces, and I'm looking for an employer that needs someone who can deliver CSS and Javascript magic.</p>
